        <P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits">Thomas Alan Waits</a>(born December 7, 1949) is an American singer,
            songwriter, musician, composer, and actor. Waits' music is characterized
            by his distinctive deep, gravelly singing voice and lyrics focusing on the
            underside of U.S. society. During the 1970s, he worked primarily in jazz,
            but since the 1980s his music has reflected greater influence from blues,
            vaudeville, and experimental genres.</P>
